This is a completely new built mesh of my previous Bryce freebie "Tower crane". As I was frequently asked for a chance to convert it for use in other applications -and there is no such chance at all- I finally rebuilt it from scratch in Hexagon and Carrara and here you`ll get an .obj...
There are no texture maps or the like - that`s up to you...;-)) - but I recommend the use of procedural mats for quick and easy results. Quality increasements like cabin interior and so on for close up use. Import tested in Bryce, Vue and Poser.

Unrestricted use, private or commercial...

Have fun!
